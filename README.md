# AI-Powered Threat Detection System
Author: Jayani Sivakumar

## Overview
The **AI-Powered Threat Detection System** is a personal project designed to leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect phishing websites. This system focuses on the intersection of cybersecurity and AI, aiming to enhance security by identifying potentially malicious sites with high accuracy.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values and encodes categorical data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Provides insights into the dataset through visualizations and statistics.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implements Logistic Regression and supports advanced models like Random Forest and XGBoost.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Utilizes GridSearchCV for optimal model performance.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Includes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for thorough evaluation.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for modeling.
2. **EDA:** Understanding the data through visualizations and statistical measures.
3. **Model Building:** Training and evaluating a machine learning model.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing model performance using GridSearchCV.
5. **Model Deployment (Future Scope):** Saving the trained model for integration into applications.
